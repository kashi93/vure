## Introduction

Vure provides a simple starting point for building a SPA (single-page application) using Vue or React with the Laravel framework. The code structure remains unchanged, and Vure can be styled using either Bootstrap or Tailwind. Additionally, Vure includes authentication controllers and views that can be easily customized to fit the needs of your application.


## Installation

Create a new Laravel application

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

Install Vure using Composer

```
composer require kashi93/vure
```

Once Vure is installed, you may scaffold your application using one of the Vure "stacks" discussed in the documentation below.
